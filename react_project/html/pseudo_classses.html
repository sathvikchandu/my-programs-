                    For me, the answer is countless times. 

                    And the question itself makes me ask more questions: can I ever know who I am? Why do I need to know who I am? Will any answer ever satisfy me?

                    When these questions overwhelm me, I find myself inspired by this quote by Indian sage,  Ramana Maharshi:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The question, ‘who am I?’ is not really meant to get an answer, the question ‘who am I?’ is meant to dissolve the questioner.”

                    Whoa. Dissolve the questioner. What does that even mean?
                </p>

                <p>
                    How can dissolving my identity help me figure out who I am?

                    Let’s try and find out.

                    Who am I = what is my identity?
                    The “answer” to “who am I” is our identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our identity is our all-encompassing system of memories, experience, feelings, thoughts, relationships, and values that define who each of us is.

                    It’s the stuff that makes up a “self.”

                    Identity is a critical component of understanding who we are. Why? Because we can break up identity into components (values, experiences, relationship).
