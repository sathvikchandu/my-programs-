            Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by Activision. Starting out in 2003, it first focused on games set in World War II.
            Over time, the series has seen games set in the midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and outer space.\
            The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then also by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games.
            Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers. The most recent title, 
            Call of Du ty: Vanguard, was released on November 5, 2021.

            The series originally focused on the World War II setting, with Infinity Ward developing the first (2003)
            and second (2005) titles in the series and Treyarch developing the third (2006). Call of Duty 4: Modern
            Warfare (2007) introduced a new, modern setting, and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series,
            creating the Modern Warfare sub-series. The game's legacy also influenced the creation of a remastered 
            version, released in 2016. Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were
            made. The sub-series received a reboot with Modern Warfare in 2019. Infinity Ward have also developed 
            two games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016). Treyarc
            h made one last World War II-based game, World at War (2008), before releasing Black Ops (2010) and su
            bsequently creating the Black Ops sub-series. Four other entries, Black Ops II (2012), III (2015), 4 (
            2018), and Cold War (2020) were made, the latter in conjunction with Raven Software. Sledgehammer 
            Games, who were co-developers for Modern Warfare 3, have also developed three titles, Advanced War4
            fare (2014), WWII (2017), and Vanguard (2021).
